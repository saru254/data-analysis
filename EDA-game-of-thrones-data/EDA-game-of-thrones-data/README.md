# Exploratory Data Analysis of Game of Thrones Dataset

## Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Game of Thrones dataset to gain insights into the show's characters, episodes, and other relevant aspects. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, relationships, and interesting findings within the dataset.

## Dataset Description
The Game of Thrones dataset used in this project was obtained from [source] and includes information about the characters, episodes, ratings, and other relevant data. The dataset is structured and provides a comprehensive view of the show's details.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the Game of Thrones dataset and any additional data files used.
- `notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter notebooks with the analysis code and step-by-step explanations.
- `visualizations/`: Contains visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Data Cleaning
Before conducting the analysis, the dataset underwent a thorough data cleaning process. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data integrity. The details of the data cleaning steps can be found in the data cleaning notebook.

## Analysis Methodology
The analysis was performed using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NetworkX. The main steps followed in the analysis include:
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Exploring the distribution and characteristics of the characters
- Analyzing the relationships and interactions between characters using network analysis techniques
- Investigating episode ratings, viewership, and other related factors
- Creating visualizations to present the findings effectively

## Key Findings
The EDA on the Game of Thrones dataset led to several key findings, including:
- Insights into the survival rates and alliances of different characters
- Significant relationships and connections between characters, as revealed through network analysis
- Patterns and trends in episode ratings or viewership
- Interesting correlations or patterns between character traits and episode outcomes

## Data Visualizations
Various visualizations were created to showcase the analysis findings, such as bar plots, network graphs, and time series plots. Examples of these visualizations can be found in the visualizations folder.

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the analysis or explore the findings further, follow the steps below:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Navigate to the notebooks directory: `cd notebooks/`
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in sequential order to understand the analysis process and findings.

## Future Directions
There are several potential directions for further exploration based on the initial findings. Some suggestions include:
- Analyzing the sentiment expressed in character dialogues
- Exploring the impact of specific events or plotlines on viewer ratings
- Investigating the influence of character traits on survival rates
